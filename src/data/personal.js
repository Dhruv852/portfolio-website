    bio: `I'm an AI & Machine Learning engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that make a real-world impact. With expertise spanning healthcare diagnostics, agricultural technology, and defense applications, I focus on creating solutions that bridge cutting-edge research with practical deployment.

My approach combines deep technical knowledge in machine learning, natural language processing, and full-stack development with a research-oriented mindset. Whether it's achieving 92% accuracy in medical predictions, deploying blockchain-based agricultural platforms, or building semantic search systems for defense applications, I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant, scalable solutions.

Currently pursuing BTech in AI & ML with a 9.3 CGPA, I'm constantly exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, systems engineering, and human-centered design.`,
